## Summary

- According to the requirements of the project, I've just developed a simple Android application which fetch the keyword from the API and show on a customized Recycler View
- If the keyword is more than one word, then display in two lines. These two lines should have minimum difference in length.
- Third-party libraries used: [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- Architecture: MVP
